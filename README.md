Qingnang Smart Diagnosis is an **end-to-end AI healthcare framework** with **field-proven application capabilities**, designed to provide efficient and intelligent solutions for the medical industry. By integrating advanced large language model (LLM) technologies, this framework has realized core functions including intelligent triage, patient registration, medical record creation, diagnosis, ordering lab tests, prescriptions, and treatment plan development. We are dedicated to enhancing healthcare efficiency, improving patient experiences, and driving intelligent transformation in the medical industry.
With a focus on ease of use and adaptability, this framework supports seamless integration via APIs with leading LLMs such as DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, and Baichuan. Whether deployed in cloud-based or on-premises environments, it enables rapid construction of **intelligent, healthcare-centric service systems**.

**Core Features**
+ End-to-End Interface: Supports HTTP service interfaces for pre-consultation, in-consultation, and post-consultation processes.
+ Flexible Data Integration: Enables customization of user-specific databases (e.g., drugs, disease names) and enhances implementation effectiveness through LLM + retrieval.
+ High-Compatibility Deployment: Allows direct access to various models via OpenAI services.
+ Multi-Scenario Adaptability: Covers diverse application scenarios such as hospitals, telemedicine, and pharmaceutical distribution.
+ Multi-Role Support: Offers comprehensive functionality for medical staff, patients, and administrators, streamlining workflows for all parties.

**Technical Advantages**
+ Agent Capabilities: Features meticulously optimized prompt instructions and reasoning workflow orchestration.
+ Key Challenge Solutions: Provides all solutions combining large model intent recognition, intent fallback, SQL distribution interfaces, and multi-channel retrieval.

+ Ready-to-Use: Comes pre-equipped with fine-tuned and enhanced training for medical domain-specific models.
+ Demo Interface: Visual business trial interface (user-friendly for non-technical personnel).


##  2. Model Downloads



All large language models can be accessed via standard OpenAI services. Our compatibility testing has confirmed support for:
**Deepseek v3, Deepseek R1, Qwen2.5, Llama 3.1, Baichuan4, QwQ, etc**. For models with strong reasoning capabilities like Deepseek R1 and QwQ, format parsing components may require adjustments.


Our fine-tuned and enhanced medical large language models, along with voice interaction-based Chinese ASR, Cantonese ASR, and TTS models, are available via the following links:

##  4. Quick Start


**4.1  Environment Configuration**

We recommend the following Docker/Conda environment configurations:
+ Ubuntu20.04、python3.12
+ NVIDIA-SMI 535.154.05、Driver Version: 535.154.05、CUDA Version: 12.2

You can use your own environment that meets the requirements, or launch a container via the following commands:

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04
sudo docker run -itd --name <container_name> -v /home/<username>:/home/workspace --gpus all --ipc=host -v /root/.ssh:/root/.ssh --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --privileged=true --ulimit stack=68719476736 --network host --shm-size=20G nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-devel-ubuntu20.04 /bin/bash

```bash
http://<openai ip>:<openai port>/v1 
```

**Data Preparation (Optional)**

We offer a function to import a custom knowledge base, which includes information about diagnoses, medicines, examination forms, etc. For specific examples, please refer to the ./database directory. You can run the following script:

```bash
python3 create_database.py
```

We also provide a function to customize quality inspection rules. For specific examples, please refer to the quality/quality.json file. The changes will take effect after you modify the file and restart the service.

**Service Startup**

```bash
python3 inference.py --model <model_name> --model-url http://<openai ip>:<port>/v1 --fastbm25 --log --host <server ip> --port <server port> --max-round 30 --database ../data/processed/database
